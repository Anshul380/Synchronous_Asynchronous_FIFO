# Synchronous_Asynchronous_FIFO
A asynchronous AND sYNCHRONOUS FIFO is designed in Verilog HDL for the exchange of data values between different clock domains. − Gray code encoding used for inter-clock domain control data transfer to avoid multi-bit signal transition . −Implemented Two Flip-Flop Synchronizer to avoid meta-stability issue in Cross Domain Clocking(CDC).
